## Description
The project was built to learn how to pull data from an external API (The cocktail db) and getting the user's input to choose drink categories and drink details, using C# and Restsharp.

Fiz primeiro as 4 primeiras classes
em seguida adicionei 3 pacotes nuget:
restsharp
newtonsoft.json (deserilialise the json response sent by the API)
consoletableext
